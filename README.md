# Roguelite-crude-html

This is the first version of an incomplete game in the style of "the binding of Issac" made entirely in html, complete with bullet physics, enemy ai, enemy targeting, bullet knockback, and dynamically generated game map (no player minimap,) control movement with wasd, aim and shoot with mouse pointer. Run it in a browser and goof around for a bit.
